================================
Overall discussion with the data
================================
- The data set has 13 attributes, and those are coord_X,coord_Y,month,day,FFMC,DMC,DC,ISI,temp,RH,wind,rain,area.
- 517 examples
- Most of the data entry for attribute area is 0, and some values of rain are 0, as well.
- Intuitively Data and month are both nominal and ordinal level of measurements, but in this data their order is meaning less.
  Therefore, they will be considered as nominal data (Make more inferences)

==============================================
Attributes (features, factors, and variables)
=============================================

coord_X - x-axis spatial coordinate within a topographical map of the area of interest. (Ratio Data)
coord_Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within a topographical map of the area of interest. (Ratio Data)

month - the month in which the forest fire happened  (Nominal)
day - the day of the week in which the forest fire happened (Nominal)


FFMC - Fine Fuel Moisture Code from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System (
DMC - Duff Moisture Code from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System
DC - Draught Code from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System
ISI - Initial Spread Index from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System
temp - temperature in Celsius degrees (interval)
RH - relative humidity in %  (ratio)
wind - wind speed in km/h  (ratio)
rain - outside rain in mm/m2  (ratio)
area - the burned area of the forest in hectares  (ordinal)

=========================
Level Of Measurements
=========================
Nominal: label name assigned to them
        - The weakest
        - (E.g. age - teen youth adult)
        - E.g. True/False
        - We do not know wheather true or false come next comes next
        - There is no distance between true and false
        - Having absence of true or false does not mean anything (not ratio)
Ordinal: Name(nominal) + order
        - A named label, and there is ordering of attributes.
        - E.g. Infant -> teen ->  young -> old
        - E.g. Student number
Interval: Nominal + Ordinal + Fixed distance
        - Temperature: 85 -> 90 -> 95
        - Temperature in celcious
Ratio: Nominal + ordinal + Interval + meaningful zero value
        - Temperature in calvin
        - Platlets counts:  having zero platlets mean something
        - Number of students (Having zero student mean some thing)

=====================
Issues with the data
=====================

Sparse data
mission values
In accurate values
Unbalanced data
Scale difference
proxy variable

=============
Importance
=============
1. Rain (Ratio): Most of its value is zero and small.
        - Therefore, it does not have much impact on the overall data mining process
2. Area (Ratio): Most of its value is zero, and it may not have a much greater impact on the overall result
3. Wind (Ratio): Vary important:
4. RH (Ordinal):Very Important
5. Temp (Interval): Very Important
6. ISI (ordinal):   Important
7. DC (ordinal):  Important
8. DMC (ordinal):  Important
9. FFMC (ordinal): Important
10. Day (ordinal):  less important
11. Month (ordinal): less important
12. Coord_Y (ordinal): Important
13. Coord_x (ordinal) Important




Data Cleaning

1. Dealing with different data types
Numeric. income
categorical: gender
ordinal low/midium/high (scale)

Models only handle numeric values so categorical data should be changed to numeric
chnage to a set of dammy values  (female =0/1 and male 0/1)

example: degree
0 - Bachelors
1 Mastes
2 highschool grad
3. 11th
example using pands
print (pd.get_dummies(X['education']).head(5))

2. Missing data
models can not handle missing data

Simple but non efficent solution
- Remove observations/features that have missing data
- Removing may cause a lot of issues
    * Potentially loss of a lot of data
    * You introduce potential biases
    * poor solution

solution: using imputation
 * Replacing values with another values
 * Strategies: mean, median, highest frequency value of a given feature


 Data Exploration
 1. Outlier detection: an autlier i an observation that deviates drastically from the normal
  it can skew your model

  solution

- Tukey IQR (inter quertial range)
    * Identifiers extrme value in a data
- Outlier detection-  Kernel Density


Find out the interaction of two variables
overfit: not go out of dimention


Dimentionality reduction using PCA

model creating

separate the data in train and test - using skit learn

FFMC - Fine Fuel Moisture Code from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System

combines measurements
of rainfall, relative humidity, temperature and wind speed to
provide an indicator of the degree of moisture in forest floor litter, its
likelihood to ignite, and the rate of likely spread of a fire once ignited.

DMC - Duff Moisture Code from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System
- Combines measurements of rainfall, relative humidity and temperature
DC - Draught Code from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System
- combines just rainfall and temperature.
ISI - Initial Spread Index from the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System
involves a correlation between FFMC
and wind velocity and is used as an indicator of how quickly a fire is
likely to spread.


Data Tidying
- Structuring datasets to facilitate analysis

Data Cleaning involves
- Outlier checking
- Data parsing
- Missing value imputation


The accuracy of my regression model turned out to negative (-ve) value which indicates my it was a really bad model. The error may have been
caused by a number of reasons. I may have been selected attributes that are really do not have over at least greater than and equal to
absolute value 0.5. The second reason the correlation between each selected element
